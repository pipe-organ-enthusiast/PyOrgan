    ADSR Envelope: amplitude that varies depending on ADSR phase

    Amplitude Envelope: amplitude controlled by enclosure setting

    Wind (Noise) Generator: random number generator in range of 0.0 - 1.0 to create white noise similar to wind

    Tremulant Generator (Modulator): Equation same as Sine Wave. 
                                     Multiplied to waveform sample to generate tremulant effect
